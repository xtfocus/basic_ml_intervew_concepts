I recenty took interviews after interviews for data scientist/NLP Engineer positions. 

After some reflection, I dawned on me that I was familiar with concepts, but didn't necessarily remember them on the spot. For some other concepts, I can recall vividly since I actually used them in recent projects. This emphasize the importance of practice.

I create this study repo to prepare myself for next interviews. I intend to apply for jobs again after 3 months of revision + practice.

I decide to use Obsidian again to structure my notes. I also make sure to include codes to demonstrate ML concepts, and of course references.
