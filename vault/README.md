Different categories of questions in interviews for DS/AI jobs include:

Technical:

- textbook [[Machine-Learning|Machine-Learning.md]] questions
- textbook data structure and algorithm questions
- DE questions (they ask this if you put 'Spark' in your resume)

Non-technical:
* Pressure handling
* Overtime
- [[Leadership|Leadership]]

For technical questions, there's too many things to remember. It's OK if you can't answer all of them, but when you do, it helps to extend your answer, showing people that you are strong at least in that area.

Extending your answer when possible also gives less time for your less familiar concepts, bolstering your overall impression.
