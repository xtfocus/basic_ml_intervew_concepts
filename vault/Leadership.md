Reason why people hire leads/senior/project manager:

- They recently found a new department, so seniority are priotized (they may hire junior positions later)
- For customer-facing and project manager positions. In Vietnam, it's common for a senior developer  to also play these roles. For these roles, they seek not just a leader but some one who can provide consultation to customers
- A lead recently quitted.
- other reasons

Ask the recruitor so you know what you are in for.

There seems to be one or two differences between Western and Vietnam companies when it comes to leadership questions. For Vietnamese companies, it usually goes by "Do you have the stomach for it". For Westerner counterparts, which I didn't have much experience with, they conversation is usually more open ended.
