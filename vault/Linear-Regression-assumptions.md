What are the assumptions for? To justify the use of linear regression models for purposes of inference or prediction. If any of the assumptions is violated, the inference is biased, misleading, or inefficient.

> (i) linearity and additivity of the relationship between dependent and independent variables:
> 
>     (a) The expected value of dependent variable is a straight-line function of each independent variable, holding the others fixed.
> 
>     (b) The slope of that line does not depend on the values of the other variables.
> 
>     (c)  The effects of different independent variables on the expected value of the dependent variable are additive.
> 
> (ii) statistical independence of the errors (in particular, no correlation between consecutive errors in the case of time series data)
> 
> (iii) homoscedasticity (constant variance) of the errors
> 
>     (a) versus time (in the case of time series data)
> 
>     (b) versus the predictions
> 
>     (c) versus any independent variable
> 
> (iv) normality of the error distribution.
